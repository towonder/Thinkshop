SETUP

Place all files on an apache webserver,
and go to that url. If you have enough rights on the /app/config -folder, you'll be able to
install the webshopsystem (like wordpress) within 5 minutes.

Frontend-files views are here: /app/views/winkel/ and the frontend controller is here: /app/controllers/winkel_controller.php

Good Luck!



TEMPLATES

Templates are not yet a part of Thinkshop 2.1 (sadly) but you can use the Cakephp template engine. Read all about it, here:
http://book.cakephp.org/view/95/View-Templates



CHANGELOG

Thinkshop beta 2.1:
Added easy 5-minute "Wordpress"-like install. Just have your database, login, password and host ready.


Thinkshop beta 2.0:
Added an extended pluginsystem on top of the CakePhp pluginsystem. Place your plugins inside /app/plugins/ and follow
normal CakePhp 1.2 rules. If you want to add front-end functions, just add a file titled /app/plugins/plugin_name/vendors/front.php,
same for the admin (only user vendors/admin.php), custom routes (vendors/routes.php) and custom menu-items (vendors/menu.php).


Thinkshop beta 1.0:
First beta copy of Thinkshop, contains easy productmanagement, mediamanagement, categories, product metadata, financial quarterly reviews,
user management and some 'Wordpress'-like settings.
