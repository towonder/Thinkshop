SETUP

Place all files on an apache webserver,
and go to that url. If you have enough rights on the /app/config -folder, you'll be able to
install the webshopsystem (like wordpress) within 5 minutes.

Frontend-files views are here: /app/views/winkel/ and the frontend controller is here: /app/controllers/winkel_controller.php

Good Luck!



TEMPLATES

Templates are not yet a part of Thinkshop 2.1 (sadly) but you can use the Cakephp template engine. Read all about it, here:
http://book.cakephp.org/view/95/View-Templates



PLUGINS

Place your plugins inside /app/plugins/ and follow normal CakePhp 1.2 rules. If you want to add front-end functions, just add a file titled /app/plugins/plugin_name/vendors/includes/front.php, same for the admin (only user vendors/includes/admin.php), custom routes (vendors/includes/routes.php) and custom menu-items (vendors/includes/menu.php).
If you need any new databasetables, place the appropriate sql in: /app/plugins/plugin_name/vendors/includes/install.php and all the uninstall sql in vendors/includes/uninstall.php.

More on this soon in the Thinkshop supportwiki. For now, check out Cake's awesome documentation on writing CakePhp plugins:
