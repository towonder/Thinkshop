THINKSHOP 2.3 "SANTANA"
Named after one of the worlds most inspiring guitarplayers, Thinkshop Santana is as versatile as creative.
With the new tagfunctions, setting related products on your website becomes a breeze, add easy-peasy language
management and multilingual admininterfaces and Thinkshop truly starts rocking the entire world.


SETUP

Place all files on an apache webserver,
and go to that url. If you have enough rights on the /app/config -folder, you'll be able to
install the webshopsystem (like WordPress) within 5 minutes.

Frontend-files views are here: /app/views/winkel/ and the frontend controller is here: /app/controllers/winkel_controller.php

Good Luck!



TEMPLATES

Templates are not yet a part of Thinkshop 2.3 (sadly) but you can use the Cakephp template engine. Read all about it, here:
http://book.cakephp.org/view/95/View-Templates



PLUGINS

Place your plugins inside /app/plugins/ and follow normal CakePhp 1.2 rules. If you want to add front-end functions, just add a file titled /app/plugins/plugin_name/vendors/includes/front.php, same for the admin (only user vendors/includes/admin.php), custom routes (vendors/includes/routes.php) and custom menu-items (vendors/includes/menu.php).
If you need any new databasetables, place the appropriate sql in: /app/plugins/plugin_name/vendors/includes/install.php and all the uninstall sql in vendors/includes/uninstall.php.

More on this soon in the Thinkshop supportwiki. For now, check out Cake's awesome documentation on writing CakePhp plugins:
