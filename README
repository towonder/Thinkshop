SETUP:


Place all files on an apache webserver,
and go to that url. If you have enough rights on the /app/config -folder, you'll be able to
install the webshopsystem (like wordpress) within 5 minutes.

Frontend-files views are here: /app/views/winkel/ and the frontend controller is here: /app/controllers/winkel_controller.php
